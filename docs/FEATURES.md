# List of features: (do not look into this!)
- more so a bug, but in activity analytics view the chart with daily weekly monthly is not generalized for all activities, and also doesnt aggregate anything. 
- notification system revamp. Sleep time (no notifications then), morning afternoon and evening set automatically. 30 mins before sleep notification. Morning notification. etc.
- Crazy alarm system
- Have sticky notes + history of notes along with each activity (embdedded links, resources, things to note etc.) + journalling for each day.. to look back in time and see. 
- Ability to edit exercises, and add notes at individual workout level, exercise level, etc.
