# List of features: (do not look into this!)
- removed archived from goal, instead have pause which is same as when underlying metrics are all paused or deleted. have paused collapsable section to see paused goals but instead of small view of goals, goals show as grayscaled view as current paused goals show
- more so a bug, but in activity analytics view the chart with daily weekly monthly is not generalized for all activities, and also doesnt aggregate anything. 
- notification system revamp. Sleep time (no notifications then), morning afternoon and evening set automatically. 30 mins before sleep notification. Morning notification. etc.
- Crazy alarm system
- Strength training, Cardio, and Posture Tracking system
- Have sticky notes + history of notes along with each activity (embdedded links, resources, things to note etc.) + journalling for each day.. to look back in time and see.
