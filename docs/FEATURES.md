# List of features: (do not look into this!)
- more so a bug, but in activity analytics view the chart with daily weekly monthly is not generalized for all activities, and also doesnt aggregate anything. 
- notification system revamp. Sleep time (no notifications then), morning afternoon and evening set automatically. 30 mins before sleep notification. Morning notification. etc.
- Crazy alarm system
- Have sticky notes + history of notes along with each activity (embdedded links, resources, things to note etc.) + journalling for each day.. to look back in time and see. 
- Ability to edit exercises, and add notes at individual workout level, exercise level, etc. 
- Currently everything gets deleted when i delete curr data. Ensure deleting importing, exporting, ensures default categories, exercises, muscle groups, etc. is not impacted. 
- allow user to edit exercises
- Goal needs to have metric for it to be active. If it's checkbox activity as metric it should show (expected consistency (user set, defaul is 80%), and actual consistency since goal started or last 365 days whichever is sooner)
- Biggest win logic is fucked -50k steps is shown as biggest win, i guess it doesnt know if things need to go up or down, maybe do only if it's guranteed, it should also show bunch of biggest wins, not just 1. Maybe for unknowns it can add as biggest changes?, but think of this logic extensively. IF we need go up or go down or stay close to goal, is better for value or metric, cumulative, etc. use the predictor from keywords as we used everywhere for this, but allow user to set it in advanced. 
- trend weekly aggregate is summing things, it should be averaging for value type, even for cumulative if aggregation is sum, it's sum only at day level, in trends it should be sum of daily, but average across days
