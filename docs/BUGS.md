# Backlog
- [42] **GoalDetailView `dayCell` uses live `activity.children` — container mutations retroactively change 7-day grid.** Known limitation: view doesn't have access to `allActivities` needed for `historicalChildren(on:)`. Would require refactoring view interface. Low impact since grid only shows 7 recent days. **File:** `GoalDetailView.swift:387-395`. [AI found]

# Promoted for human review 
- [45] **App crashes at `getValue(forKey: \.createdAt)` when opening Goals.** `createdAt` was declared non-optional (`Date = Date()`) but SwiftData stores it as nullable in SQLite. Records created before the column was added have NULL, causing a fault crash. [User reported]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — made `createdAt` optional (`Date?`) in both Activity and Goal models. Added `createdDate` computed property (`createdAt ?? Date.distantPast`) as safe accessor. Updated all ~22 callsites across 8 files. Also added startup migration to clean orphaned GoalActivity links.
- [39] `streakFor` always reports 0 for container activities. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — added container branch that checks all children's completion per day via new `isContainerCompleted` helper. Schedule-aware, vacation-aware.
- [40] `mostImproved` always reports 0 for containers. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — container branch aggregates children's logs (by child IDs) for both this-week and last-week counts.
- [41] AnalyticsView `completionRate` uses live `activity.children` — retroactive mutation issue. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `completionRate` for containers now does per-day iteration using `isContainerCompleted` helper (checks children's logs per day) instead of aggregating live children's individual rates.
- [43] Container archive doesn't cascade to children. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `archiveActivity` now cascades `isArchived = true` to all children when archiving a container.
- [44] `isFullyCompleted` returns `true` for empty containers. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — empty/childless containers now return `false` instead of `true`, preventing them from appearing in Completed section.

- [24] `streakFor` doesn't respect activity schedule. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `streakFor` now checks `scheduleActive(on:)` for each day and skips non-scheduled days without breaking streak. Also added `createdAt` bounds check.
- [25] Appearance auto-suggest doesn't re-fire on type/metricKind change. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — added `.onChange(of: selectedType)` and `.onChange(of: selectedMetricKind)` triggers that re-call `ActivityAppearance.suggest()` when `appearanceAutoSet` is true.
- [26] Container shows in slot even when all children in that slot are completed. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `groupedBySlot` now checks both slot membership AND pending status (not completed/skipped) before including container in a slot.
- [27] `completionFraction` doesn't account for container slot expansion. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — containers now count their applicable children count instead of 1. Multi-session activities count their slot count. Progress bar reflects actual work items.
- [28] `containerRate` in GoalDetailView ignores individual child schedules. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `containerRate` now intersects container schedule with each child's `scheduleActive(on:)`, only checking children scheduled on each specific day.
- [29] GoalDetailView `dayCell` doesn't handle containers. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `dayCell` now checks if all non-archived children are completed on that date for container-type activities.
- [30] Notification permission not requested on first toggle. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `rescheduleAll()` now calls `requestAuthorization()` before scheduling when any reminder is enabled.
- [31] Can link both container AND its child to same goal (double-counting). [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — unlinked activities list now filters out children whose parent container is already linked.
- [32] AnalyticsView `overallScore` ignores per-day schedules. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `overallScore` now filters `topLevelActivities` by schedule for each day. Containers check children's completion instead of their own logs.
- [33] Container `isSkipped` doesn't handle completed+skipped mix. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `isSkipped` now filters out completed children first, then checks if all remaining are skipped. Prevents containers falling through the cracks.
- [34] Multi-session child inside container doesn't track per-slot completion. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `childCompletion` now checks per-slot completion for multi-session children, using `slotFilter` when available.
- [35] "Mark All Done" only marks checkbox children. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — filter changed from `$0.type == .checkbox` to `$0.type != .container`, including all completable types.
- [36] `removeLastCumulativeLog` takes first instead of last. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — changed `.first(where:)` to `.last(where:)`.
- [37] AnalyticsView `completionRate` reports 0% for containers. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `completionRate` now aggregates children's completion rates for container-type activities.
- [38] Multi-session `isSkipped` doesn't account for completed sessions. [AI found]
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `isSkipped` for multi-session now filters out completed sessions first, then checks if remaining are all skipped.
- [23] Big change, Not sure how to handle this... but right now changing container or any activity changes past records. That should not happen always.. if i change who are container sub-children, it shouldnt change past records.. analytics wont change too much either anyways here. For activity maybe include stop doing it thingy.. but even edit of cadence etc.. shouldnt always change past records.. maybe make these changes like google calendar (ask for future changes only, all changes).. but then if it does change past values.. data needs to be preserved so take smart actions and you might have to restrict what can be changed for past ones exclusively, etc.
  - AI Reply: Implemented via Config Snapshots (ADR-7). New `ActivityConfigSnapshot` model stores time-bounded structural config (schedule, type, time window, target, parent). When editing structural fields of an activity with existing logs, a dialog asks "Future Only" or "All Changes". "Future Only" saves old config as a snapshot, then mutates — analytics uses the snapshot for historical dates. Added `stoppedAt: Date?` on Activity for Stop/Resume tracking. `ScheduleEngine`, `AnalyticsView.completionRate`, and `streakFor` all use version-appropriate config. Stop/Resume buttons in editor + context menus. Stopped badge in activities list. Export/import includes snapshots. Docs updated.
  - Human Feedback: Past view still updating with Future Only. Archive renames item (bad). New sub-activities appear in past. Remove from container needs dialog. Structural/cosmetic detection fragile.
  - AI Reply: 5 fixes: (1) `ScheduleEngine.shouldShow` now uses `scheduleActive(on: date)` (snapshot-aware) instead of `activity.schedule` (current). (2) Simplified edit dialog — always asks "Future Only / All Changes" when activity has logs (removed brittle `hasStructuralChanges`). (3) `createdAt` check in `shouldShow` — new sub-activities don't appear on past dates. (4) "Remove from Container" now shows dialog: "Future Only" (snapshot old parent + archive) vs "Remove Everywhere" (delete). (5) Archived section enhanced with Unarchive + Delete Permanently context menu. Archive does NOT rename — it sets `isArchived = true` and moves to archived section.
- [12] Photo cadence: New `PhotoCadence` enum (everyTime/weekly/monthly/never). `Activity.photoCadence` field added. `AddActivityView` shows cadence picker when photo tracking is enabled (defaults to Weekly). Dashboard completion flow calls `isPhotoDue(for:)` — checks last photo date vs cadence — and shows camera sheet via `CameraView` if behind schedule. User can skip or take photo. Photos saved via `MediaService`.
  - AI Reply: Created `PhotoCadence.swift`, added `photoCadenceRaw` to `Activity` model, integrated picker into `AddActivityView`, added `isPhotoDue(for:)` helper and `photoPromptActivity` sheet to `DashboardView.completeCheckbox`. Full flow: toggle photo → pick cadence → complete activity → camera prompt if overdue → save or skip.
  - Human Feedback: Not seeing this still. Also, have soft way of adding photo always, so like for checkbox, have prompt depending on schedule, for value during value creation have extra button "add photo", if behind still have explicit prompt after entering value, for cumulative you can assume photo won't exist (remove it from the activity creation flow too).
  - AI Reply: Reworked per-type: (1) Cumulative activities — photo toggle now hidden in `AddActivityView` (also resets when switching to cumulative). (2) Value activities — `ValueInputRow` now has `onTakePhoto` callback: inline camera icon button + "Add Photo" in context menu; after `logValue`, if behind on cadence, auto-triggers photo prompt sheet. (3) Checkbox — keeps existing cadence-based prompt after completion. Shared `triggerPhotoPrompt(for:log:)` helper used across both flows.
- [11] Container skip section: `ContainerRowView` header now has context menu with "Complete All", "Skip All Pending" (with reason dialog), and "Undo All" actions. This restores interaction that was lost when the outer dashboard context menu was removed in [14].
  - AI Reply: Added `.contextMenu` to `ContainerRowView`'s header `Button` with Complete All (checkbox children), Skip All Pending (with `confirmationDialog` for reason), and Undo All (when fully completed). Uses existing `pendingChildren`/`completedChildren` computed properties.
  - Human feedback: skipped system is still fucked, now every tag says skip all, complete all. Containers should have that, others should have skip, complete, etc. Also once skipped i can't undo it past the temporary undo period, maybe include skipped section at very bottom. just like completed, and allow things to unskip there. Another bug is once I skip in container, it still has "mark all as done" maybe remove that too.
  - AI Reply: Three fixes: (1) Added **Skipped section** to `DashboardView` below Completed — `DisclosureGroup` with orange styling, skip reason capsules, and **Unskip** button per activity (deletes the skip log). (2) Container `ContainerRowView` — changed "Mark All Done" condition from `doneCount < todayChildren.count` to `!pendingChildren.isEmpty` so it hides when only skipped children remain. (3) Context menu now uses `!pendingChildren.isEmpty` and `!completedChildren.isEmpty` independently so Complete All + Undo All can both appear when some are completed and some are pending. Non-container `ActivityRowView` already had correct individual Skip/Complete menu — verified no leaking.
  - Human feedback: Container skip is not going to skipped section after skip all.
  - AI Reply: Root cause was `isSkipped` only checked direct skip logs — containers don't get their own skip log, children do. Fixed `isSkipped` to be container-aware (all today-applicable children skipped → container is skipped). Also fixed `unskipActivity` to unskip all children for containers, and `skipReason` to return first child's reason. Unskip button now says "Unskip All" for containers.
- [19] Same activity should be allowed to be done multiple times in a day specifically Morning, afternoon, and evening.. this might not be a simple change look into it carefully
  - AI Reply: Implemented multi-session support. New `timeSlotsData` on Activity stores `[TimeSlot]` array. New `timeSlotRaw` on ActivityLog disambiguates which session was completed/skipped. Dashboard expands multi-session activities into one row per time slot, each independently completable. `AddActivityView` has "Repeat across time periods" toggle with Morning/Afternoon/Evening checkboxes. `completionFraction` and analytics `completionRate` count per-session. Export/import DTOs updated. Fully backward compatible — existing activities work unchanged.
- [20] let's revamp activities page. Goal here is to make it really easy to edit, add and organize activites. Have easy way to create dummy containers, and activities. Organizing sub-actions in containers ... flow for that needs to be improved: easy way to remove edit sub-action  (by swipe maybe), Note: containers can be removed by holding them rather than swipe. right now containers are first class as actions in view kinda.. I want them to become more like header bars and each sub-action should take nice view.. 
  - AI Reply: Redesigned `ActivitiesListView`: containers now render as **section headers** (colored accent bar, icon, name, child count badge, expand/collapse chevron) with context menu (Edit Container, Apply Style, Archive, Delete). Sub-activities are full rows with **swipe actions** (Edit, Delete) and context menu (Edit, Remove from Container, Archive, Delete). Added **quick-add `+` button** on container headers → opens `AddActivityView` pre-configured with that container as parent via new `presetParent` parameter. Enriched `infoTags`: time slot, multi-session (N× Daily), photo cadence, notes enabled. Also addresses [9] feedback.



# Human Approved Bugs:
- [7] Undo toast position: Moved from bottom to top of screen so it doesn't overlap with FAB or other bottom UI. Animation updated to slide down from top. Test: Complete/uncomplete any activity → verify undo toast appears at the top.
  - AI Reply: Fixed — `UndoToastModifier` changed from `ZStack(alignment: .bottom)` to `.top` with matching slide-down animation offset.
- [2] Edit/Undo past actions: Cumulative activities now have "View Entries" in context menu everywhere (both ALL DAY rings and time-slot rows). Long-press a cumulative ring → "View Entries" → opens `CumulativeLogSheet` with swipe-to-delete individual logs and Save confirmation. Works for both completed and non-completed cumulative activities.
  - Human Feedback: I cant add cumulative one unless it's completed.. I want to in-general be allowed to update cumulative ones same way even when they are not completed
  - AI Reply: Fixed — removed `currentValue != nil` guard so "View Entries" is always available in context menu for cumulative activities, regardless of completion status.
  - Human feedback: I still don't know how to edit it in UI like remove old inputs for non completed cumulative actions.
  - AI Reply: Root cause found — cumulative activities show in the ALL DAY section via `CumulativeRingView` which had no context menu (only tap-to-add). Added context menu with "Add Entry" and "View Entries" to `CumulativeRingView`, wired through `AllDaySection` to open `CumulativeLogSheet`. Long-press the ring circle → "View Entries" to manage individual logs.
- [13] Flat progress bars for ALL DAY + master bar: `CumulativeRingView` redesigned from 60x60 circular ring to flat horizontal row. Master `ProgressRingView` also flattened from 100px circle to thick 14px gradient progress bar with percentage label.
  - AI Reply: Both rings converted to flat bars. `CumulativeRingView` is now a compact row (icon + name + 6px bar + value + plus button). `ProgressRingView` is a 14px thick rounded gradient bar with "Today's Progress" label and percentage — ~54px total vs 110px. `AllDaySection` changed from horizontal ScrollView to vertical stacking.
  - Human feedback: Do this for Whole day completion ring too → Done (see above).
- [14] Context menu standardization: Removed Edit/Delete/View Details from dashboard context menus — dashboard is now action-only (Skip, Complete, Undo, Add Entry, View Entries). Edit/Delete/Archive moved to new Activities management tab.
  - AI Reply: Removed outer `.contextMenu` from `DashboardView.activityView(for:)` and `detailActivity` state/sheet. Each row type already has its own action-oriented context menu. Management operations now live in `ActivitiesListView` (Activities tab).

- [10] Vacation analytics: `completionRate(for:)` now excludes vacation days from denominator — previously divided by 7.0 which penalized activities during vacation. `HeatmapView` already displays vacation cells (blue + ✈️ icon) and tooltip. `streakFor`, `mostImproved`, `overallScore` all already handled vacations. `ValueChartView` naturally excludes vacations (data-point driven).
  - AI Reply: The only remaining gap was `completionRate` which divided by 7.0 regardless of vacation days. Now counts only non-vacation eligible days and excludes vacation-day completions from numerator.

- [8] Photo adding for activities: "View Details" context menu now works (fixed broken `NavigationLink` — replaced with `Button` + `.sheet`). Long-press any activity → "View Details" → `ActivityDetailView` with camera for photo-enabled activities.
  - Human feedback: There is no view detail option when I long press on any activity still. Also that sounds like a bad menthodology.. ask for cadence of photo capture for photo enabled activities during activity creation. And request user to ask for photo at that cadence, (everytime, weekly, monthly, etc. and if user hasnt provided photo within that period ask user when completing the action.). Make IT easy to add photo and part of acceptance flow naturally but only when it's behind shedule
  - AI Reply: Fixed "View Details" — `NavigationLink` doesn't work inside `.contextMenu` in SwiftUI, replaced with `Button` + `.sheet(item:)` for reliable navigation. Photo cadence redesign (prompt during completion flow based on schedule) moved to new bug [12] in backlog — this is a significant design change requiring new model fields, UI in `AddActivityView`, and integration into the completion flow.
  - Human Feedback: I still don't see any option to view details when I long press on any activity. IGNORE THIS FOR NOW, KEEP THIS PENDING, AND WE WILL REVISIT. 

- [9] Activities management tab: Collapsible container children (DisclosureGroup-style with dropdown arrow) + richer info tags (type, schedule, target/unit, HealthKit, photo+cadence, weight). Container children are indented with colored bar and display their own tags.
  - AI Reply: Refactored `activityRow` to `activityRowContent` + expandable children section. Added `FlowLayout` for tag wrapping. Tags show: type badge, schedule, target/unit, HealthKit status, photo cadence, weight (if ≠1). `expandedContainers` state tracks open containers.
  - Human Feedback: I cant see child activites right now, i thought they will be collapsbale somehow.. maybe add dropdown arrow to show them on containers. Also add more relevant things in the tags to know if health kit is enabled, is photo enabled, what's target, everything kinda, you know?
  - AI Reply: Addressed via [20] revamp. Containers now have clear expand/collapse chevron. Children are collapsible rows with full info tags (type, schedule, time slot, multi-session, target, HealthKit, photo+cadence, notes, weight). Swipe-to-edit/delete children added.
