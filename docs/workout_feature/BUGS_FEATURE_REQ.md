# Don't look here unless asked

- [1] You can simply complete the session in main dashboard, these sessions should not be completable.. activities are not marked all day but just morning
- [2] when I activate new session it deletes the old one (disappears), have separate coalesced section for deactivated plans + draft plans, sort by recency of creation
- [3] there is no videos capability for exercises.. include that even though by default it's not there. 
- [4] I cannot edit sets RIR etc. for added workout, also UI currently sucks ass in iphone 17 pro.. text is too small, complicated.. advance section in muscle thing has a chart to show different set interval range, i think color is doing good enough job for that, we dont need color bar for each of them.. sub-muscles dont have color coded for their set count. One more idea is to have top level 7 day summary (current blocks) and then one big editable swipable blob where I can make edits for one day at a time, and swipe etc. 
- [5] Start strength doesnt disappear even after you logged the workout in workouts tabs. 
- [6] when i click paused timer keeps going, it does go back to where i paused when i click resume.
- [7] **[FUTURE] Apple Watch Companion App** — Build a WatchKit companion that auto-starts the correct workout type (Run/Swim/Cycle) on the Watch when a cardio session starts on iPhone. This enables real-time HR streaming, Watch GPS distance, swim stroke/lap detection, and cardio zone tracking. Currently using iPhone GPS for distance only.
